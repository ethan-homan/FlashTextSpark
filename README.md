# FlashTextSpark

A thin spark wrapper around the FlashTextJava library done by [jasonsperske](https://github.com/jasonsperske/FlashTextJava).
That project was a port of the [flashtext.py](https://github.com/vi3k6i5/flashtext) into Java.

## Building

Just clone the repo an if you are on UNIX:
```
./gradlew build
```
or on windows:
```
./gradlew.bat build
```
This will bootstrap the project with all the dependencies, just requiring
java 8 to be installed.
